      Dissertation: "[The Feasibility of 3D Printing with Multicopters](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/items/f8c656c3-65bf-4b98-9650-2e08013c2158)," which studied how drones could be used for 3D printing while flying to overcome current challenges in concrete printing with ground-based robotic systems.  In my research, I demonstrated the [first-ever printing while flying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEooDpE2TyE) of a standard 3D printing material with a custom-built hexacopter.

## About Me

I'm Alex. I built the first-ever drone that can deposit standard 3D printing material on a surface while flying. I have a deep background in robotics, artificial intelligence, and general systems engineering. While finishing my PhD and still being on an F1-student visa in the US, I have built an artificial intelligence company that has received seven-figure funding from the DOD to build crucial technology for the US Air Force and the Pentagon.
