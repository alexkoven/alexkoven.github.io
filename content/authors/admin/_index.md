      Dissertation on the ["The Feasibility of 3D Printing with Multicopters,"](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/items/f8c656c3-65bf-4b98-9650-2e08013c2158) which studied how drones could be used for 3D printing while flying to overcome current challenges in concrete printing with ground-based robotic systems. Supervised by [Prof. Ufuk Topcu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jeNGFfQAAAAJ&hl=en). Side Note: My research was concurrent to  ["Aerial additive manufacturing with multiple autonomous robots,"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04988-4) a Nature publication by more than two dozen European researchers that studied a similar research problem (most of my results were published before their publication).

## About Me

I am the CEO and Co-Founder of Multi AI, where we're developing cutting-edge autonomous AI systems for complex and adversarial environments. With a Ph.D. in Robotics from UT Austin, my research has focused on pushing the boundaries of what's possible in autonomous systems, including inventing the first-ever 3D printing drone. My work spans the intersection of artificial intelligence, robotics, and advanced manufacturing, with particular expertise in drone swarm technology and control systems.
As a leader in the field, I've secured multiple military contracts and formal support from various Air Force programs, while maintaining active involvement in the academic community through publications and mentorship. My experience includes over a decade of work in robotics and AI, with significant achievements in both technical development and business leadership.
