# Alexander's Website

These instructions are what I used to set up my website. I am not familiar with Hugo or the underlying languages. Fortunately, the template along with a few helpful tutorials linked below make the process fairly straightforward.

## Setting up website
1. Clone from [Hugo Academic CV Theme](https://github.com/HugoBlox/theme-academic-cv)
2. Follow [installation guide](https://docs.hugoblox.com/getting-started/install-hugo/) to install required dependencies. Make sure Hugo is at least v0.136.5.
3. cd into the cloned repository and run `hugo server` to test the website locally.


## Modifying the Website
